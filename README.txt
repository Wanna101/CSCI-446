The project that we pitched was quite a bit more involved than we expected as it entailed creating a fully working social media app.
We are excited to say that we made good strides in this direction and ended up with a functioning version of Mumble Jumble.

- Were there areas of unexpected complexity? If so, how did you handle them or how did you decide to cut scope?
Some areas of unexpected complexity were the user authentication (and everything that went into setting this up) and the creation of new accounts.
In order to handle these complexities, we decided to cut scope in other areas that were not quite as pressing. 
For example, we decided to cut out the "Following" page as this involved setting up connections between various users and displaying posts that were specifically created by people that a user follows.

- What was the most interesting part of the final project?
The most interesting part was getting to apply all of the concepts that we have learned in class to a real and big-scale project. 
It was fun to see that despite the components themselves being simple, when you put them together, they can build something quite intricate.

- If you had more time, what do you wish you could have added to the final project?
We wish we would have been able to implement the "Following" page. After all, Mumble Jumble is a social media page that you can use to connect with other.
